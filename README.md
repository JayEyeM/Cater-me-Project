# Cater-me-Project
My first project for Get Coding program. In first stages.

On the index.html page:
    Users will be able to view upcoming events they have added, in a list/table below the create new event button.

On the ingredientList.html page: 
    users will be able to fill out form and add new ingredients to a list/table below, with a "delete ingredient" button next to each added ingredient.

On the newEvent.html page:
    Users will be able to fill out the form for creating a new event. Including being able to search for ingredients from ingredients list using a search bar, or using the dropdown menu and scrolling through their ingredient list. Once they find desired ingredient needed specifically for the event being created, they can click the "Add Ingredient to Event" button, which shows up in a list/table below. 

    Based on "# of attendees" for the event, and the "Portions" assigned to an ingredient when it was added to the main ingredient list, the "quantity needed" can be calculated and will appear along side the ingredient in the event specific ingredient list. 

    Based on "Quantity Needed" and "Price $" that was assigned to the ingredient when it was added to the main ingredient list, "Cost" can be calculated for the event specific ingredient.

    Once all ingredients needed for event are added, and table below or next to it will calculate "total Ingredient Cost", "Other Expenses Cost", "Customer Cost", Expected Profit".
